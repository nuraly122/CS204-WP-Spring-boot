Hotel System Management using Spring

Admin has the ability to add, remove customers from a total number of 10 rooms.

With this project we can:
1) Add customer to some empty room, if you attempt to add person to reserved room, suitable message will pop out
2) View empty rooms
3) Search by customer name
4) View all rooms
5) Delete customer from room

I used MYSql DBMS to create a table to describe the hotel.

Connected Room by using Data Access Object and Implemented it by special class.

Also I used events that also can be handled by this class.

Annotations were very crucial to use in my project, by using @Component, @Autowired I managed to get rid of unneccesary coding.
